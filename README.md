### What it can do?
- Can list networks
- Can show which server software and which version of it is the most popular.
- Can list every TheProtocols user and show their personal information as much as they allow.

### What is used?
- [TheProtocols](https://github.com/islekcaganmert/TheProtocols) made this possible.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) gave the power of open source.
- [python3](https://python.org) is the reason it is easy to understand the source code.
- [BevyFrame](https://github.com/islekcaganmert/bevyframe) helped to do it all in python3 instead of also using HTML.
- [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/) made it look beautiful.
